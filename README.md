# Prog2 :: Davey Demos

## Whats in this repository?
### Tutor Demos 👨‍🏫
These are the demonstrations from the start of my lab class each week. They are loosely based on the canvas "tutor demos", but with extra content.

### Lecture Demos 🎓
This is an exact copy of the code demonstration in the lectures from Spring of 2024. You may recognise these from the study modules as well.

### Exam Help 📝
This contains all of the patterns from the subject converted into Notebook form. This allows you to modify and run the pattern in line. Officially speaking, these are not subject materials/resources, I hold no responsibility for any errors contained within them. The official subject content is on canvas and canvas only.

## How do I run it?
The demos in this repo are mainly designed as a reference for you to browse or compare to your code; but I'm sure you would want to run some of the projects yourself.
- 🐍 **Python** is designed to run single files. You can safely open the entire repository at it's root in your favourite IDE and just choose whichever file to run.
- ☕ **Java** is not as lenient. You will likely run into issues trying to run one of the demos if you have the repository open at it's root. Unless you want to dig into annoying configuration shenanigans, it is safer to open the demo of choice in your IDE of choice and run it as a project.
